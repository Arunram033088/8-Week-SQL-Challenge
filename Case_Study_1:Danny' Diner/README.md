Danny's Diner is a little restaurant that sells three Japanese foods:

* sushi
* curry
* ramen

The owner, Danny, would like answers to some questions he has about the customers, their favorite meals, and how much they spent so he can develop a personalized experience for his loyal customers. He has collected some basic data and would like the answers to come from the data analysis.
